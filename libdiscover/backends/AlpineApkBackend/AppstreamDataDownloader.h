/**
 * @class AppstreamDataDownloader
 *
 * @details The job of this class is to download appstream data
 * gzipped XMLs from some web server.
 *
 * Some distros (for example, Alpine Linux) do not provide
 * appstream data as installable package, instead they host it
 * on the internet (at https://appstream.alpinelinux.org) and
 * software center app has to download them on its own.
 *
 * Those files are not very large (from few kilobytes to couple
 * of megabytes) but we still need them.
 *
 * URLs to download archives from are stored in JSON files in
 * /usr/share/libdiscover/external-appstream-urls/ directory
 * (QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation/libdiscover/external-appstream-urls
 * from C++/Qt code, ${DATA_INSTALL_DIR}/libdiscover/external-appstream-urls
 * from cmake).
 *
 * JSON file format:
 * ---------------------
 * {
 *      "urls": [
 *          "https://url1",
 *          "https://url2",
 *          ...
 *      ]
 * }
 * ---------------------
 * These JSON files, if needed, should be provided by the linux
 * distribution.
 *
 * This class can load any amount of those JSON files,
 * fetch URLs from them and download all files pointed by
 * those URLs to discover's cache directory:
 * "~/.cache/discover/external_appstream_data" (aka
 * QStandardPaths::CacheLocation). Use
 * getAppStreamCacheDir() to get this path.
 * If files are already present in cache and not outdated,
 * they are not downloaded again. Default cache expiration
 * time is 7 days and can be tweaked using
 * setCacheExpirePeriodSecs().
